	<h3>How We Met</h3>
	<p>One winter morning when snow was in the air and a new semester of classes had begun, Isabel Beeley and Jenna Beutelschies found themselves in the Engineering I class. Being 2 of only 5 girls, Jenna asked to sit next to Izzy. Izzy said yes. They ended up partnering on every project in the class. They bonded over the construction of robotic arms, rockets, and a bookstand that attached to a laptop. Though difficult, they somehow made it through. Miraculously, they showed up that August and realized they had Intro to CS together! They immediately partnered up and worked on many websites and videogames together. They also bonded over chemistry and made up a weird language using "air quotes". The most fun part of this project was coming up with the titles for the different rankings. We hope you enjoy our game, Tree Cat! </p>
